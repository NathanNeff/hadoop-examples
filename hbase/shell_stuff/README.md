This is playing around with the hbase shell, and trying to
get to underlying Java objects.

To run these things, use:

    hbase shell <ruby_sript.rb>


Example:

    hbase shell inspect_HTable.rb

# Run with parameters

The check_new_stuff/run_parameter_script.sh is rudimentary example of invoking hbase/ruby
script with parameters.
